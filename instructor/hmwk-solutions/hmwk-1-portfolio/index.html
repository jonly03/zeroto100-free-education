                Student @ UC Davis
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="card-text review-quote">
              If you walk into a classroom and Nelly is your instructor, be aware that you're luckier than any person
              who
              has won the lottery!
              <br>
              <br />
              Nelly has passion, heart, and a way of teaching that "doesn't make you feel [dumb]" (quoting from another
              student of his). He puts in every effort to ensure his students learn and understand both the front-end
              and
              back-end portions of full-stack development.
              <br />
              <br />
              On several occasions, he met with me and my group (for many hours) for our projects to teach us how to use
              MySQL, Handlebars.js, React, rendering the proper code onto the page, and a refresh of how Git branches
              worked. He worked with me in my own project on using MongoDB, Mongoose, discussed plans and diagrams on
              how
              to approach React and Mongo on said project, and met with me several times on Zoom to code with me,
              remaining patient the entire time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Not only can he teach, he develops his own apps, as well - along with coding an app featuring a card game
              from his home country, he also coded and promoted (ie, drove to multiple cities to test it) an app for
              pick-up basketball (which made me slightly more interested in the sport)!
              <br />
              <br />
              It was an honor to be Nelly's student - I'm glad he took the leap and flew to California to teach the
              inaugural class of UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp!
              <br />
              <br />
              Thanks, Nelly! :D

              Nelly is an amazing Instructor. I was his student for 3 months
              full time camp. I learned a lot from him. He's very knowledgeable.
              He had well thought deep answers to all of my questions and my
              classmates'. He is very patient and thorough when it comes to
              explaining complex material in a simplified way. He has a strong
              ability to keep his students engaged and interested in the
              material he teaches. It was very obvious he has a strong deep
              knowledge of the technologies he taught us and of the software
              development field in general. I worked closely with him during my
              projects and class work and could experience how talented he is.
              He has a very amiable presence and would be a great, valuable
              addition to any place/position he's in. I'm grateful to him for
              all the knowledge he gave me and the hours of help he offered me
              beyond his classroom responsibility. He showed the he sincerely
              cared about us and never left any of us no matter what was the
              level of help we needed.

              Google Doodles history starts on 1998/8/30 when Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, designed
              the first Google Doodle to let Google users at the time that Larry and Sergey were at the Burning Man
              Festival, just in case the servers crashed :). Ever since, Google has been designing Google Doodles to
              celebrate different people and events through out history.
              <br /><br />
              Having always been intrigued by them, naturally, I built a web app that
              can go back into history and tell you which Google Doodle was used on which date.
